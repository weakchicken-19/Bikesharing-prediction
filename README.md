# Bike sharing
## ABSTRACT


Bike sharing is a method of renting bicycles. With the popularity
of smart phones, shared bicycles, as an important part of the urban
transportation system, are convenient, efficient, economical, and
environmentally friendly. Data such as rental time, rental, return
location, and time consumption generated by this rental system
have attracted people’s attention. The rental system has also become
a perception network. The aim of our project is to predict the rental
needs of the rental system with historical data from Washington.

## 1 INTRODUCTION


The report is aimed to predict bike sharing demand by studying from different variables. After some preparation on this problem and searching other authors’ methodology that try to solve it before, the first step was to download data from kaggle. Then we used Python to visualize the data and random forest was applied to fill the missing values. Then it goes to feature extraction and training to find the best and most accurate model. RMSLE is to measure our performance. The smaller the value is, the better the model fits the data.
